[coffeeShopImpl1] :

    Beverage is an abstract parent class which has two main methods getDescription and getCost. All the child classes
    inherit from that Beverage class and set its own attributes.

    You can find some items in coffeeShopMenu like ChocoCoffee, ColdCoffee, HotCoffee and couple of hundreds.

    The problem arises where suppose the prices of the coffees increase, also each item can have different configurations
    like hot coffee with whipped milk or hot coffee with added cream, so there are hundreds of possible permutations.

    One intuition would be to add all these properties in the Beverage Class itself and then just set these booleans on runtime.
    This approach is represented in Impl2.
